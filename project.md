# Project Alexandru
Project Alexandru is an algorithm, or a set of instructions fine-tuned for myself, Tepes Alexandru, in order to have the healthiest lifestyle possible according to my body, as well as my mental state. Project Alexandru aims to be a routine of actions that is repeatable every day in order to increase longevity and quality of life.

Project Alexandru is a set of supplements, diet, exercise and other habits that allow me to be the best version of myself.

## Protocol:
### Supplements
In the morning:
- Zinc 15mg
- Omega-3
- Lagosa (temporary, for liver)

In the evening:
- Omega-3
- Lagosa (temporary, for liver)

### Diet
- Mediterannean Diet. Eat legumes and fruits as much as possible, as well as protein from sources such as chicken.
- Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- Zero Alcohol. Alcohol is literally poison for the body. It damages the liver and affects the conscious mind, making it more aggressive, depressive or not taking into account the future.
- Zero Sodas (Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Fanta, etc). Sodas are loaded with sugar and High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS), which damages the liver and causes inflammation.
- Zero Coffee. Coffee makes me feel anxious, and doesn't give me actual energy, it just tricks my brain into thinking it's not tired.

### Exercise
Intensive exercise has been shown to always give me a better mood and increased levels of energy, as well as lowering my anxiety levels by a lot.

Best high intensity sports:
- Swimming (2-3 times a week)

### Other
Guided Meditation has made me more aware of my surroundings, of the thoughts that I have or just simply to relax. I do the following guided meditations:

- Morning Inspiration ~6-10 minutes in the morning
- Daily Sleep ~10 minutes before going to bed

## Experiments
### Keto Diet ❌
I've tried this diet in the past, but it was not sustainable in the long term. Not eating any carbs is very hard, especially from a social standpoint. Also, not eating carbs means also not eating enough fiber, which leads to problems such as constipation. Besides this, going on the Keto diet also made my cholesterol go up in the upper limit, which wasn't great. For this reason, the diet has been discontinued.
